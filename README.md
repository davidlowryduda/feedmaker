feedmaker
=========

This is a simple RSS 2.0 feed maker in python3. This relies on minidom to generate the xml.

Th was based on the earlier [rss2producer](https://github.com/nathan-osman/rss2producer) by nathan-osman, who generously licensed his work under the MIT license. This version works with python3 (and accepts some nonstandard RSS 2 elements for minor abuse).

There is currently no additional documentation for this package.
